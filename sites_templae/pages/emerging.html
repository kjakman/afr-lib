                <h3>Editions have heritage</h3>
                <p>Artists have been creating editions of artworks for centuries. Hokusai’s Edo-era woodcuts, Rembrandt’s lithographs, Rodin’s bronze sculptures, Warhol’s silk-screen prints and Lange’s photographs all have multiple copies.</p>

                <h3>Artists Love Digital</h3>
                <p>Artists have painted with computers since their invention. Starting with Laposky in the 1950s, through to Warhol in the 80s and more recently Hockney’s iPad paintings. The rise of digital photography and video art means increasingly, no physical original artwork exists.</p>

                <h3>Collectors Love Digital</h3>
                <p>Collectors buy into digital. Regardless of whether it is books, films, music, magazines, news, maps or ringtones, content that often used to exist physically is now bought, rented or borrowed as computer code. There are few cultural barriers to collectors streaming art.</p>
