        that we will enforce to protect both guest and host alike. 
        <!-- The Super Strict cancellation policies apply to special circumstances and are by invitation only.--> 
        The Long Term cancellation policy applies to all reservations of 28 nights or more. 
        Each listing and reservation on our site will clearly state the cancellation policy. 
        Guests may cancel and review any penalties by viewing their travel plans and then clicking 'Cancel' 
        on the appropriate reservation.
